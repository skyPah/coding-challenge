Thanks for taking the time to do our front-end / full-stack practical coding challenge.

The objective of this challenge is to evaluate your domain knowledge in front-end / full-stack development: code organization, style and best practices.

# Overview:
The main challenge will be to build a simple user management tool that will perform basic CRUD operations on a user. Please use mockups as a reference 
about look of the application. There are no business rules & guidelines other than to show us what you’re truly made of. It can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.

### Prerequisites
There is none :) Our main solutions stack include but not limited to Kotlin, Java, AngularJS, Flutter, Spring...  
Feel free to use any languages and technologies you are comfortable with.

### Front-end:
- For API please use https://reqres.in/.

### Back-end:
- The API should be similar to https://reqres.in/, performing basic operations for user.

_We'll be happy if you cover application with tests._

### Submission Guidelines
- Please fork the repo and then submit a Pull Request when you are done.
- Instructions must be provided to run the application, install any dependencies, and any other information needed.
- Please use version control and make sure we can see the history of how you went about it, rather than just uploading the complete project to GitHub.

## Questions? ###
Please feel free to reach out and ask any questions while you are working on a solution.
